## Quiz 18
#### Program code
Create a function to help Lily

Program using an equation
```.py
def numberMatches(length:int, seconds:int)->int:
    return length * 100 / seconds / 5
test1 = numberMatches(100,100)
print (test1)
```

Porgram using a while loop 
def numberMatches (length:int, seconds:int) -> int:
    lily_position = 0
    speed_m_per_s = seconds/100
    seconds_passed = 0
    matches = 0
    while lily_position < length:
        seconds_passed += 1
        #move lily
        lily_position += speed_m_per_s
        if seconds_passed == 5:
            matches += 1
            seconds_passed = 0
    return matches

test1 = numberMatches(100,100)
print (test1)
```
