## Unit 1 Reflection
#### 1. What worked well during Unit 1?

Something that worked quite well was how organized and neat my repository was. The folders I created allowed me to easily access whichever data I needed 
as its exact location was not a secret. Another thing that I will definitely keep doing in order to stay on track is asking for help. Although I did not 
seek help from the teacher as much as I should have, my friends were always there to aid me when struggling.

#### 2. What did not work well?
On the other hand, something that I should have done better was to make sure I fully understood a certain task before moving on. For instance, the quizzes.
I often times completed them and mindlessly moved on to the next topic without comprehending the program I had made. This led me to not make the connection
and never truly learn when to use particular statements or helpers.

As mentioned before, I should have also not kept doubts to myself and sought guidance from Dr. Ruben to avoid further confusion. I now know to simply raise
my hand and ask questions whenever they arise or follow through after class and send an email asking for help.

Finally, time management, or perhaps lack thereof was certainly not my forte during this first unit. A lot of issues could have been avoided had I begun 
the project earlier, for instance. My knowledge and understanding could have expanded thoroughly if I had set a clear and rather strict timeline for myself
in order to avoid stress and last-minute complications.

#### 3. What did you enjoy the most during project Unit 1?
What I enjoyed the most about project 1 was certainly the freedom of choice we had. Although as a class we had the same aim, to create a digital ledger, we
all took very unique paths in order to achieve so. We could pick the criteria and objectives of our ledgers so although we ended up with similar final 
products, not one of the ledgers was the exact same as another one.

I also enjoyed the overall structure of the classes; the quizzes, the explanation of such, the introduction to a topic, and from there on it was all about 
digesting the content and applying it. The quizzes in particular challenged my skills and allowed me to apply the computational skills we learned about 
earlier in the year.

#### 4. What talent have you discovered or practiced during this unit?
No particular talent discovery has been made (at least not yet) but the course has allowed me to explore my creative mindset most classes don't 
necessarily cater for. From flowchart drawing to even picking the colors of outputs, I have enjoyed putting my artistic input into the making of 
tasks in Computer Science.

#### 5. What is working well in Computer Science for you?
The learning log is a tool that contains everything one could ever ask for in Computer Science. From quizzes we do during classes, to helpful resources, 
this document has enabled me to deepen my understanding of the subject. Dr. Ruben being very helpful is also a great addition as he is always keen on 
guiding people who may be confused.

#### 6. What can Dr. Ruben do better to support you during Unit 2?
I think something that can be done better is potentially adding more resources such as videos for topics some people may not be completely familiar 
with. For instance, we just began looking into transistors and lots of students in my class immediately grasped the concept as they had seen such a 
topic before. For others, though, it was completely new and some sort of background information could have been helpful.
